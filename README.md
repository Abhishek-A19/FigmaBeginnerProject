# Project Title: Creating a Login Screen Like Instagram with Animations, Theme Switcher, and Prototyping for Testing
# Description
*This project involves designing and developing a modern, visually appealing login screen inspired by Instagram's clean and user-friendly interface. The goal is to recreate a similar login experience with added features like smooth animations, a theme switcher (light and dark mode), and the use of prototyping tools to test the flow and usability of the design.*

# Key Features
1) Login Screen Design: 
    The design will feature elements similar to Instagram's minimalist style, focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and a seamless user experience.
2) Animations: 
    Subtle animations will be incorporated to enhance user interaction, such as button transitions, logo fades, and form field focus animations. 
    These animations will improve the feel of the interface and provide feedback to the user.
3) Theme Switcher: 
    A toggle feature will allow users to switch between light and dark modes, providing a customizable and comfortable experience for different lighting conditions.
4) Prototyping: 
    Using prototyping tools like Figma or Adobe XD, a fully interactive prototype will be built to simulate the login process. 
    This prototype will be used for usability testing, gathering feedback, and refining the user flow before final implementation.
# Objective 
The purpose of this project is to improve user engagement through attractive design, smooth animations, and intuitive features. The use of prototyping will also allow for rapid iteration and testing of the design before development, ensuring an optimal user experience.

By the end of the project, a fully interactive and user-tested prototype will be ready, showcasing an elegant, functional, and highly usable login screen.
